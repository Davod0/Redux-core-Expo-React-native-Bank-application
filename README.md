This is a React Native project built with Expo to improve my skills in Firebase and Redux Toolkit. The project aims to demonstrate how to integrate these technologies to build a robust and scalable mobile application.
In this project, I'm integrating my application with a Firebase database and I'm also utilizing Redux Toolkit to effectively manage the application's state.
I even use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in and sign up.

All command lines used to install the dependencies are listed below:
npx create-expo-app@latest --template
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install redux
npm install react-redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install firebase
npx expo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
